** _cmd **
x mouse or keyboard events pass through between java apps?
+ or use internal computer clock or millis()
+ move data folder outside of sketch

** spectrum **
+ implement timing coord
+ read from verdicts.csv
+ vertical orientation
+ crop freq distribution to most meaningful
+ snapshots at moments in time
+ display snapshots full, vertical
+ gradient blue to red vertical, use lerpColor
+ add current time in min, sec, frames and snapshot time
  maybe in green? or red? led 7-segment?

** detector **
+ read from verdicts.csv
+ Verdict class based on Word from kings
+ add sound control and timing control from kings
+ include static colors lookup dictionary
+ correct colors
+ compare println of read_csv to file, last row chopped
+ int rounding errors when setting frames (frame/30)
+ multiline txt wrap
x alternate type? helv, arial, menlo
x adjust colors
+ verdict 3 seconds
+ no verdict = black
x add render.pde
- add render functionality (maybe still render.pde)
+ exit minim gracefully .close() super.stop(); public
- videoExport filename spec (.pde file name?)
- add sketch_name to video filename

** waveform **
x read from verdicts.csv    
+ implement timing coord
/ add render.pde    
- exit minim gracefully .close() super.stop(); public
- add sketch_name to video filename

** spectrogram ** 
+ merge with spectrum/ but keep both
+ rotate_hue() in process but not yet working
+ integrate audio sync
+ screen black in before fft values exist
+ analyze, but mute (add boolean setting?)
+ add black < 50, add white > 200 in rotate_hue()
+ freeze and fade after 3 secs
x flash screen when snapshot flash_screen()
+ fix render_audio_to_txt() in render.pde (fft logic) 
+ clean up use of Boolean render in spectrogram.pde
- exit minim gracefully .close() super.stop(); public
- add sketch_name to video filename

* v4 .mov (3) out asap
